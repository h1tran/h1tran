My name is Henry, and I am passionate about technology! ðŸŽ‰

I've always had a strong interest in web development when I first began in high school. 
The thing that I personally enjoy the most about my career is the sense of fulfillment and empowerment that comes with driving positive change. 

If you're interested in the work that I do, have any questions, or just want to have a coffee chat sometime - feel free to connect!
